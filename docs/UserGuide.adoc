== Introduction
$AVE IT is a desktop budget management application. As most tertiary students
are at a stage without a fixed income, they can use this to manage their
spending. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using a CLI
(Command Line Interface). The application is ideal for tertiary students who
are comfortable with typing.


== Quick Start
.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `$AVE IT.jar` coming soon.
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for $AVE IT application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing `help` and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* `exp add -i chicken rice -a 4.50`: adds new expenditure and information.
* `exp delete 3`: deletes the 3rd expenditure shown in the current list.
* `exit` : exits the app.

.  Refer to <<main-commands, Main Commands>> for details of each command.

[[main-commands]]
== Main Commands

====
*Command Format*:

Let's use a command format, +
`exp add -i INFO -a AMOUNT [-t TAG] [-d DATE]` +
as an example.

* The first word is the *operation category* of the command, in this case, `exp`
belongs to the expediture operations.
* There may be a second word which is the specific command for the operation
category, in this case, `add`.
* Words starting with `-` e.g. `-i`, `-a` and `-t` are the *option prefix*. Not all
commands have options, an example is deleting an expenditure, `exp delete 1`.
* Words in caps are the *parameters* to be supplied by the user. `INFO`, `AMOUNT`
and `TAG` are parameters representing information, amount and tag of the
expenditure respectively. It can be used as such,
`exp add -i chicken rice -a 4.50 -t food`.
* Items in square brackets are optional, that means in this example
`exp add -i chicken rice -a 4.50` is also valid.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies
`-i INFO -a AMOUNT`, `-a AMOUNT -i INFO` is also acceptable.
* However, if the parameter is not prefixed by any option prefixes, the order of
the parameter matters.
