== Introduction
This section will introduce the intended use of the document and how to navigate it.
[[Introduction-Purpose]]
=== Purpose
The purpose of this document is to give insight to the implementation of the app, $AVE IT. This
will give developers a better understanding on how they can work on the app in the future.

[[Introduction-Usage]]
=== Usage
==== Navigate
Navigate the document by using `control - f` for Windows User or
`command - f` for Mac Users. Alternatively, there is a clickable content page

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `exp delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `exp delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the Main UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The Main UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` , `Calendar` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
//tag::ReportUI[]

.Structure of the Report UI Component
image::ReportUIClassDiagram.png[]

The Report UI consists of a `ReportWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `ReportCommandBox` and `Result Display` etc.
The `ReportWindow` and `ReportCommandBox`, inherit from abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. Layout of `ReportWindow` is defined in `.java` file that is in the `src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui` folder. For example the layout of `ReportWindow` is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-3/main/tree/v1.3/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui[`ReportWindow.java`]
Layout of `ReportCommandBox` is defined in matching `.fxml` file that is in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-3/main/blob/v1.3/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/ui/ReportCommandBox.java[`ReportCommandBox`] is specified in link:{repoURL}https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-T10-3/main/blob/v1.3/src/main/resources/view/ReportCommandBox.fxml[`ReportCommandBox.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
//end::ReportUI[]

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the Parser Component
image::LogicParserClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TopLevelParser` class to parse the user command.
.  Depending on the command, the `TopLevelParser` class may use the
`SubLevelParser` class e.g. `ExpLevelParser` to parse the command instead.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("exp delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `exp delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `ExpDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the `$AVE IT` data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<BaseExp>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

.Structure of the Expenditure Component
image::ModelExpClassDiagram.png[]

The above image shows how the `expenditure` package interaction within itself,
and other model components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/saveit/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `$AVE IT` data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.saveit.commons` package.

== Implementation

//tag::account[]

=== Disjoint Account (Jiang Jiahui)
The disjoint accounts feature aims to help users better organise their expenditures by allowing them to separate the expenditures into different accounts.

==== Rationale
The user may be involved in different projects or have different roles which require expenditure tracking. Disjoint accounts aim to provide a higher degree of organization than just organising by date or tag.

==== Implementation
Below is a simplified class diagram that shows how the Account class relates to other classes (interfaces not shown).

.Simplified Account class diagram
image::AccountClassDiagram.png[]

Refer to <<Expenditure-Implementation, Expenditure Implementation>> and <<Repeat-Implementation, Repeat Implementation>> for more details on these classes.

There are many commands that allow the user to add, delete, rename accounts and so on.
Below is a sequence diagram that shows how a command to rename an account takes place.

.Sequence Diagram for execution of `acc rename` command
image::AccountRenameSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration


This section contains some of our design considerations for the account feature.

*Consideration:* Storage of expenditures and repeats.

|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros*  |*Cons*
|1. Store expenditures and repeats in the same list.
|Fewer methods, since we can use the same method to add, edit or delete an expenditure/repeat.
|Worse time complexity for some tasks which need to differentiate between expenditures and repeats.
|2. *[current choice]* Store expenditures and repeats in separate lists.
|Better time complexity for tasks such as calculation of total spending.
|There needs to be double the number of getters, setters, methods to add, edit & delete the items.
|===

*Consideration:* What to use for the backing list of the ListView UI component.

|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros*  |*Cons*
|Exposing the repeat and expenditure lists in the accounts
|Less troublesome when a repeat or expenditure command is executed.
|More difficult to implement. Every time the active account is changed, the ListView has to be replaced as the backing list cannot be changed.
|2. *[current choice]* Maintain a single list in the AccountList class as a backing list of the ListView.
|There is no ambiguity as to which list is currently being displayed. This is safer as the lists in the accounts cannot be directly modified outside the Account class.
|More troublesome when a repeat or expenditure command is executed, since both the active account and the list has to be updated.
|===

//end::account[]

//tag::expenditure[]

=== Expenditure (Jiang Jiahui)
This is the most essential and basic feature of the application.

==== Rationale
The user can create expenditures to keep track of what they spend on, how much they have spent, and when it happens.

[#Expenditure-Implementation]
==== Implementation
Below is a class diagram that shows the Expenditure class and how it relates to other classes.

.Expenditure class diagram
image::ExpenditureClassDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration

*Consideration:* Number of tags an expenditure can have

|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros*  |*Cons*
|One expenditure can have multiple tags.
|More flexibility for the user.
|More difficult to implement. This also makes it impossible to calculate total spendings for each tag due to possible overlapping.
|2. *[current choice]* An expenditure has exactly one tag.
|This makes it possible for the user to see total spendings per tag using the <<Report, Report>> feature.
|Less flexibility for the user.
|===

//end::expenditure[]

//tag::repeat[]
=== Recurring Expenditure feature `Repeat` (Zheng Shaopeng)
Recurring expenditure is one of the main features in `$AVE IT` and it is
an expenditure automatically logged for user at their preferred frequency.

==== Rationale
`Repeat` allows user to keep track of expenditures that will occur either _daily_, _weekly_,
_monthly_ or _annually_ without the need to key in the expenditures every day or month.
Hence, this will provide more convenience for users as well as address the need
for such a feature since recurring expenditures are common. For example, day to day
commuting expenses.

[#Repeat-Implementation]
==== Implementation
Below is a class diagram shows different components that `Repeat` contains.

.Class diagram for showing what `Repeat` consist.
image::repeatClassDiagram.png[]

For each account, it has its own `list` which all the `Repeat` objects are stored.
There are different types of command that is cater for `Repeat` such as add, edit and delete.
The following activity diagram shows what how a `Repeat` can be added.

.Activity diagram for `repeat add`
image::repeatActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration
|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros* |*Cons*
|*(Current choice)* Have a repeat class which extends `BaseExp`.
|Able to mass delete and edit all the expenditures under this `Repeat` easily.
|Hard to implement, especially when we have to calculate monthly spending so to generate report and statistics.
|Mass operation: add `Expenditure` object to all those dates which state in the command.
|Easy to implement.
|User are unable to edit all the expenditures which are recurring. +
Users have to delete such expenditures one by one.
|===
//end::repeat[]


//tag::budget[]
=== Budget (Lim Feng Yue)
Budget feature allows user to input their budget for any month, and calculates
the balance from the total spending. Depending on the amount of balance and
whether the budget is set, different piggy bank images will be shown.

==== Rationale
As the application is about budget management and expenditure tracking. Budgeting
is an essential feature to allow user to keep track on how they are spending
their money.

==== Implementation
The budget feature consists of using a command, and a part of the UI display.

The following activity diagram shows what happens to the `BudgetView` which
displays the budget details when a command is entered.

.Activity Diagram of Budget View
image::BudgetActivityDiagram.png[]

The implementation of setting the budget of the month is through the command
format of `exp setbudget -a AMOUNT -ym YEAR_MONTH`. The process of how the command
is parsed is shown below using an example, `exp setbudget -a 123 -ym 2020-04`.

.Set Budget Sequence Diagram (UI and Logic)
image::BudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]

The above sequence diagram shows the interaction of the user and the UI. After entering
the command, the `BudgetView` will be updated using the result returned by
the `LogicManager`.

The information displayed are:

. The budget amount, e.g `$123.00`
. The total spending in `2020-04` (month)
. The balance, which is the difference between the budget amount and the total
spending
. An image as visual feedback

The sequence diagram below shows a more detailed view of what happens inside the
`LogicManager`.

.Set Budget Sequence Diagram (Logic and Model)
image::SetBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Calculation of Budget
|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros*  |*Cons*

|*[current choice]* Budgets are set monthly only.
|- Most common budget setting type. +
- Easy to implement.
|- It is not useful for users who prefer other kinds of calculation of budget.

|Variability in how budget is calculated, e.g. weekly, monthly, yearly.
|- Gives users more choice on how they want to budget.
|- Way more difficult to implement.
|===

===== Aspect: Visual Display of Budget
|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros*  |*Cons*

|*[current choice]* Display 3 states of budget balance in image.
|- Easier to see if the budget is being met.
|- Requires a bit more code, and finding images.

|No visual display, just text display.
|- Very easy to implement.
|- The UI may look a bit plain.

|Better UI display, showing different variations of whether budget is met e.g.
a chart.
|- Gives users better insight on how they are handling their budget.
|- More work is required.
|===
//end::budget[]

[#Report]
//tag::Report[]
=== Report (Ng Xinpei)
Report is one of the main features in `$AVE IT`  and its purpose is to collate and
show users their expenditure breakdowns.

==== Rationale
The report feature is an important feature that allows users to see their
expenditure breakdowns within a certain time period. Currently, the expenditure
are categorise in terms of tags and this will give users a clear overview of
what they are spending on over this period of time.


==== Implementation
The report feature can be accessed from 2 platforms either *Main Window* or *Report Window*

* *Main Window*

The input from user is parsed using a specific command parser
depending on which of the 3 commands: `report view`, `report print` and `report export` were inputted by user.

.Sequence Diagram for View Report Command Creation
image::ReportViewCreation.png[]

If a valid  `report view` command was input, the _ViewReportCommandParser_ will parse the input and convert the Strings :
start date, end date, graph type  and organisation into _Date_ , _Report.GraphType_ and _organisation(String)_ object respectively.
These objects are used to create the  _ViewReportCommand_ object. *Figure 19*  provides a detailed flow for how _ViewReportCommand_ object is created.

As shown in *Figure 19*, when a user inputs a valid `report  view` command:

1. `report view` command will be parsed and a new _Report_ object will be created.
2. A new _ViewReportCommand_ object containing the _Report_ object will be created.

.Sequence Diagram for View Report Command Execution
image::ReportViewExecution.png[]

The _ViewReportCommand_ object will be executed.
The result of the execution is popping out of  _ReportWindow_ which will showcase a expenditure breakdown report.

*Figure 20* provides a detailed flow for how _ViewReportCommand_ object is executed.


As shown in *Figure 20*,

1. The _ViewReportCommand_ object will be executed and a new _GenerateStats_ object will be created.
2. The _GenerateStats_ object will calculate and generate statistics from
_ReportableAccount_ object requested from _Model_ through `getReportableAccount` method.
3. A new _Pie_ object will be created.
4. A new _CommandResult_ will be constructed and returned.
5. Report Window will pop out.


If a valid `report print` command was input, the _PrintReportCommandParser_  will parse the input and convert the Strings :
start date, end date, graph into _Date_ , _Report.GraphType_ and _organisation(String)_ object respectively. These objects
are used to create _PrintReportCommand_ object which will be executed.
The result of execution will be sending a print job to your printer, printing out the report.


If a valid `report export` command was input, the _ExportReportCommandParser_  will parse the input and convert the Strings :
tart date, end date, graph into _Date_ , _Report.GraphType_ , _organisation(String)_ and _file name(String)_ object respectively.
These objects are used to create _ExportReportCommand_ object which will be executed.
The result of execution will be exporting a PNG version of the report into your computer with file name.


.Activity Diagram for Report in Main Window
image::Report_MainWindow_.png[]
The activity diagram summarises what can happen when user
enter a `report` command in the *Main Window*

* *Report Window*

The *Report Window* can be accessed via the  _Report button_ in the *Main Window* or via `report view` command.

.Activity Diagram for Report Window
image::Report_ReportWindow_.png[]

The activity diagram shows what can happen when users enter in a new command
in the *Report Window*.


==== Design Considerations

*Consideration : Minimal changes to current UI implementation, especially Main Window*

** Pros:  Less dependency with current working code for Main Window. Hence, even if report feature fails, it is
likely that Main Window can continue running.

** Cons: It could be more complicated to implement.

*Consideration : Avoid cluttering the Main Window UI*

** Pros: Better user experience.
** Pros: As report is not using any space in Main Window,
we could introduce and showcase other smaller and useful features in
the Main Window UI.
** Cons: It could be more complicated to implement

Due to the above considerations, we implemented report viewing in a pop up window.

==== NOTE
1. While it is allowed for users to state any date range for report and have any number of tags, it is recommended to them
that to keep the *date range within 12 months* for *reports generated by months* or *keep number of tags to be within 12* for *reports generated by
tags* due to sizing issues.
2. Overlaps can occur in PieChart when there are huge differences in expenditure values,
hence it is recommended to users that Bar Chart should be used in such instances.
3. While it is allowed for users to send multiple print jobs, users are recommended
to avoid sending multiple print jobs in a short interval.
4. Only months or tags with total spending of more than 0 dollars will be reported.

//end::Report[]

//tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar feature (Zheng Shaopeng)
==== Rationale
Calendar is a feature that has a clickable calendar which users
can use to navigate between the different days. It also shows
the date of the expenditures the user is viewing as well as today.

==== Implementation
The implementation of the above functions will be described separately in this section.

The users are given two different choice on how to navigate between
the days: +
*1*. UI interaction with the calendar view. +
*2*. Make use of `go YYYY-MM-DD` command. +

The following sequence diagram shows you how the `go YYYY-MM-DD`
(E.g `go 2020-04-01`) command works.

.`UI` and `LOGIC`  component for the `go 2020-04-01` command
image::goSequenceDiagram.png[]

Upon completion of the above command, the calendar view will update the
active date to be `2020-04-01` and expenditures records for
`2020-04-01` will be displayed.

If the user chooses to navigate through UI interaction with the calendar view
(aka clicking on the date that is shown on the calendar). The implementation is
very similar to the `go` command, `calendarView` will invoke `go` command when
user click on the dates.

.Activity diagram showing what happen when user wants to navigate to other date
image::calendarActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration
This section contains some of our design considerations for the calendar feature.

*Consideration:* How are we going to present the expenditure records.

|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros*  |*Cons*
|1. Make use of a month list to contain all the expenditure records of the given month.
|This is able to provide a concise view of expenditure view especially when there are only a small number of records.
|This looks like excel sheet and users have to scroll all the way up if they want to view a date which is much earlier.
|2. *[current choice]* Make use of a calender view and only list out a given date's expenditure record.
This automatically helps user to organize the records according to date.
|User can make use of the calendar view to navigate between the dates,
this is much more convenient than scrolling through a list. +
This helps user to organize the expenditure and keep it tidy.
Especially helpful if there is lots of records.
|It is much more troublesome to implement.
|===

==== NOTE
Dates with negative year are allowed. E.g `-1234-03-21` is allowed. +
The developer team follows the range which is specified in the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html[LocalDate Api, released by Oracle].
//end::calendar[]

//tag::autocomplete[]
=== Autocomplete feature (Lim Feng Yue)
Completes the command that the user is typing in the command box.

==== Rationale
The autocomplete feature makes it easier for user to know what commands there
are in the application. As the application is also catered for users who prefer
typing, this feature can be of great assistance and helps in efficiency.

==== Implementation
The autocomplete feature is facilitated by `AutoCompleteTextField`.
It extends the `TextField` component of JavaFx and provides a dropdown of
possible commands using `ContextMenu`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the autocompletion.

.Autocomplete Sequence Diagram
image::AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

. Type into the command box. The function searches and filters potential commands
that the user might use.
. The commands will then be displayed in a dropdown format which the user can
refer to when keying commands.

During the start up of the application, a list of commands are added to the
`AutoCompleteTextField`. These commands will then be sorted lexicographically in
the java implementation of `TreeSet`.

A `ChangeListener` is added the text field to 'listen' for changes in the input.
`TreeSet#subSet()` is used to obtain all the commands between the previous text
and the current text. For example, the textbox shows `ex` and a `p` is added, so
the current text is `exp`. `TreeSet#subSet()` will obtain the commands that are
lexicographically between `ex` and `exp`. These commands will then be shown in the
autocomplete dropdown.

.Autocomplete Activity Diagram
image::AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Consideration
===== Aspect: Usage of autocompletion
|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros*  |*Cons*

|*[current choice]* Using up and down arrow keys to select autocompletion.
|- Easy to implement.
|- Requires the text field to be in focus.

|Use of tab to simulate autocompletion like a terminal.
|- Intuitive for people used to using a terminal.
|- Will have to direct the tab keystroke to be used for autocompletion.
|===

===== Aspect: Data structure

|===
|*Alternatives* |*Pros*  |*Cons*

|*[current choice]* Sorting lexicographically using `TreeSet`.
|- Easy to implement.
|- Can be slow if sorting through a huge number of strings.

|Using a prefix trie.
|- Extremely fast.
|- Takes up a lot of space.
|===

The curent choice is chosen as the number of commands is not a lot, so high
performance is not required.
//end::autocomplete[]

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size
